# SQL Server on Linux
This is the code repository for [SQL Server on Linux](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/sql-server-linux?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788291804), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book is your handy guide to setting up and implementing your SQL Server solution on the open source Linux platform. You will start by understanding how SQL Server can be installed on supported and unsupported Linux distributions. Then you will brush up your SQL Server skills by creating and querying database objects and implementing basic administration tasks to support business continuity, including security and performance optimization. This book will also take you beyond the basics and highlight some advanced topics such as in-memory OLTP and temporal tables.
By the end of this book, you will be able to recognize and utilize the full potential of setting up an efficient SQL Server database solution in your Linux environment.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapters 1,2,3  do not contain any code as they are introductory chapters.

The code will look like the following:
```
1> ALTER DATABASE CURRENT 
2> SET COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL = 130;

3> GO
```

This book is a highly practical guide for SQL Server on Linux. We focus on how to get things up-and-running, whether or not you have any prior SQL Server or Linux experience. To achieve the full potential and get the maximum benefits from this book, you will need one of these Linux distributions: Ubuntu 16.04 or Ubuntu 17.04, openSUSE Leap 42.2 or openSUSE Tumbleweed, Kubuntu 16.04 or 17.04, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3, SUSE, or Linux Enterprise Server v12 SP2.
Last but not least, you will need to install SQL Server on Linux. At the time of writing, the last actual version was SQL Server on Linux RC1. I recommend the Developer edition. We have tried to keep all the code as user-friendly and readable as possible. We feel that this will enable our readers to easily understand it, and readily use it, in different scenarios.
